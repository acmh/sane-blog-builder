# About

## This thing
This is a static blog generator.

It uses Ruby to generate static HTML pages from Markdown or other HTML files. This is done mostly by [Nanoc](https://nanoc.ws) and its dependencies.

### Features
* Basic blogging functionalities (a page that lists all posts, a page to show the actual post, tagging etc)
* Syntax highlighting
* A page that shows posts by year
* A page that shows posts by tag
* Stupid emojis ðŸŽ¨ (okay that's just your browser)
* That's about it.

### Why?
First of all: why not?

Okay, now the longer answer. As many other cavemen I began blogging in the now prehistoric early 2010s. The few blogs I've created were mostly on the also prehistoric Wordpress platform. It was (is, I suppose) an easy way to spew ramblings on the Internet while also being nice and comfy for people to actually read, despite my atrocious front-end skills. In other words, it Got Shit Doneâ„¢.

Alas, as I opened my eyes to the wonders of web development I started noticing a few things. First, Wordpress is written in PHP, which is gross (just kidding). Second, you don't really control much: you can pick themes or whatever, but you won't have the full control you'd have by creating a website from scratch or nearly scratch. Third, and maybe a corollary to the previous point, that stuff is *bloated*. There's approximately 3 terabytes of mostly useless javascript, ads and all kind of crap I don't care about.

But most importantly, I realized the hidden costs of most "free" web services. You don't really own anything. You provide content, and Wordpress or Google or whoever serves that content to your audience together with whatever else they see fit.

I won't pretend these ideas are new. They aren't! I feel there's been an increasing amount of [Web 1.0 nostalgia](https://code.divshot.com/geo-bootstrap/) going on, and a big part of that is probably fueled by [similar sentiments](https://tjcx.me/posts/consumption-distraction/) as those I described. The [longing for simplicity](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/) in a world of trillions of new JS frameworks is also quite widespread these days.

### So I built this

I tried [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for a while, but I found myself endlessly tweaking CSS details and config files and weird deployment issues instead of actually improving the blog or writing stuff, so I gave up on that and started this thing. The goals were to create the simplest possible blogging system with as little fluff as possible.

This small project is nothing special. There are [much better projects](https://github.com/remko/blog-skeleton) [available for free](https://clarkdave.net/2012/02/building-a-static-blog-with-nanoc/) on the interwebs done by people that actually know what they're doing with a CSS file. This here is just a tiny vase with some ugly flowers -- it would be ridiculous to compare it to the beautiful walled gardens of Medium or Wordpress. But, ugly as they are, they're **mine**!
